# Reverse to Make Equal

Given two arrays A and B of length N, determine if there is a way to make A equal to B by reversing any subarrays from array B any number of times.
Signature
bool areTheyEqual(int[] arr_a, int[] arr_b)
Input
All integers in array are in the range [0, 1,000,000,000].
Output
Return true if B can be made equal to A, return false otherwise.
Example
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
B = [1, 4, 3, 2]
output = true
After reversing the subarray of B from indices 1 to 3, array B will equal array A.Reverse to Make Equal
